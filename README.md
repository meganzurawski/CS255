Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? The client was a company called DriverPass aiming to help people pass their driving exams on the first attempt using new design. They wanted to design a system that had levels of users that could access various types of content. The users also could schedule in-person training and in-person lessons with certified instructors. This system was going to manage everything and provide the admins with special functionality of the system.

What did you do particularly well? I liked the background of this project, being able to understand the functionality and the process behind the design was something I did well.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? I would change a lot of my work behind this project, I fell behind several weeks with a lot going on and didn't set aside the appropriate time or energy to fufill this to the fullest. It is difficult to manage everyday life, work, school, and everything else life has to offer, so trying to find better balance for the next time.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?  Understanding and interpreting user needs is essential in designing effective systems. By analyzing specific information, considering context, and leveraging system capabilities, we wanted to deliver relevant responses. Clear communication ensures users receive understandable and accurate information, enhancing satisfaction and usability. Designing with user needs in mind not only improves system effectiveness but also fosters engagement.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? When approaching software design, I prioritize understanding the requirements and goals of the system. I begin with analysis of user needs, system functionalities, and technical constraints. This involves gathering and documenting requirements, creating use cases, and defining the system. To ensure scalability, I use techniques such as modular design, where components are developed independently. Continuous feedback and development help refine designs based on user feedback and evolving requirements. Clear communication and collaboration with stakeholders ensures alignment throughout the design process, ultimately delivering software that meets both technical specifications and user expectations.
